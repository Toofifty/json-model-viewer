# JSON Model Viewer

Provides a quick and easy way to display and visualize models in the dreaded .json format.

## Usage

The jar no longer needs to be placed in a certain directory, as of v1.1.2+ and instead finds the correct assets folder from the load/save path.

Simply either use `Open...` or paste your JSON into the text editor to start viewing and live-coding. (and save to an `/assets/<mod|minecraft>/models/<block|item>/` directory for textures)

***

`Tools -> Refresh JSON` will completely reformat the JSON in the editor. Just a heads up.
