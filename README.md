# JSON Model Viewer

Provides a quick and easy way to display and visualize models in the dreaded .json format.

## Usage

***

Ensure the jar file is in the same directory as your '/assets/' folder, as it loads all textures and parent models in a similar fashion to regular Minecraft.

Run the jar, and paste your model's code into the control frame's text area. Click 'Update model' to display your model in the OpenGL window. If nothing displays, your json file may be invalid.

Please post any issues/suggestions on the [issue tracker](issues).
